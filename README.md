# woocommerce-compat
A library to provide some help with abstracting away differences between WooCommerce versions.

WooCommerce changes its internals quite a lot. Most extension authors like their extensions to run across a range of versions. This library is code that I wrote to help with abstracting away some of the differences with my extensions (https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/shop/).  

It is not my personal aim to create a comprehensive library. If you wish it to contain something that it does not, then please consider contributing a pull request. I am happy to accept pull requests, but will not be coding compatibility methods that I have no personal use for.
